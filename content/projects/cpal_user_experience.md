### CPAL automatization 

#### Context

The Centro Peruano de Audici√≥n, Lenguaje y Aprendizaje (CPAL) had a bad user experience on its website, one of de main problems was the procedure to find the triage button, complete de form button and waitting for specialist's response that takes one or two weeks. Other main problem was 

As part of the UX , it was required to make a system that manages the input of information from users and its subsequent analysis.

In the first spring the goal was to send a reminder via WhatsApp to users who did not complete their online triage (as if it were an abandoned cart). The Cloud Api WhatsApp was used to send messages, Python FastApi for the development of the microservice and BigQuery for storing the information.

In the second Spring was the storage of information of the completed triages and the optimization of the code, I managed to reduce up to 70 percent of the server response time.

The third spring was the integration of the Culqi payment gateway, the data was managed and stored. 

Finally the last Spring consisted of the production release, vulnerability review and automated testing.
